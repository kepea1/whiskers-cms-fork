          Your dog will benefit both physically and mentally from socialising
          and playing with other friendly dogs on group walks. Walks are in safe
          open spaces away from roads in places especially chosen to provide
          excitement and mental stimulation for your dog. Walks are varied and
          usually include some time in woodland and also in open fields, they
          are carefully planned to suit the particular dogs and weather
          conditions at the time. Group walks are great fun for the dogs and can
          help reduce boredom, anxiety and destructive behaviours at home. They
          also learn valuable social skills whilst out with their friends. Your
          dog will come home deeply relaxed and sleep soundly after their walk.

          for with love while youâ€™re away.
